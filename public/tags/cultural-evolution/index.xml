      <description>SettingRarely in writing about markets do I see their origins explained. MMT and neochartalism serves an important role in describing the function of money, taxes, and markets. But the historian in me is drawn to a very specific question — how, descriptively, did markets and money emerge? It’s common to hear the complaint that a thing’s origins need not constrain that thing’s future uses or functions. This is certainly true, but it’s also somewhat silly of a point to raise.</description>

      <description>A Disclaimer: I am interested in political economy and political evolution so unsurprisingly, I read a fair bit of history and ethnography. Chartalism/neochartalism deeply interests me because it is one of the few attempts, that I am aware of, to deeply understand the construction of some of the key institutions of history – money, markets, and the state. I like the neochartalist story because it fills a niche I generally see ignored.</description>
