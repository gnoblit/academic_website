      <description>SettingRarely in writing about markets do I see their origins explained. MMT and neochartalism serves an important role in describing the function of money, taxes, and markets. But the historian in me is drawn to a very specific question — how, descriptively, did markets and money emerge? It’s common to hear the complaint that a thing’s origins need not constrain that thing’s future uses or functions. This is certainly true, but it’s also somewhat silly of a point to raise.</description>
