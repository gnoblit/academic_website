  I am the Senior Data Scientist for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Children's Hospital: Los Angeles where I work on a variety of problems related to clinical practice and research. Previously, I was a Post-Doctoral Scientist at the [Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society at the University of Toronto](https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca/) and [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) where I use game theory to understand how norms, culture, and political institutions evolve and how such insights can be applied in artificially intelligence. I received my Ph.D. from the [Culture, Cognition, and Coevolution Lab](https://coevolution.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University where I worked on econometric and game-theoretic approaches to cultural and political institutional evolution.
