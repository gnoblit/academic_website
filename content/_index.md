  I am a Post-Doctoral Scholar at the [Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society at the University of Toronto](https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca/) and [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) where I use game theory to understand how norms, culture, and political institutions evolve and how such insights can be applied in multi-agent reinforcement learning. I recently got my Ph.D. from the [Culture, Cognition, and Coevolution Lab](https://coevolution.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University.
