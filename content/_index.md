description: I am a cultural evolutionist in the [Culture, Cognition, and Coevolution Lab](https://coevolution.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. Though my interests are broad, they revolve around the evolution of institutions, human social-learning, and the fascinating relationship between culture and minds. I am particularly interested in applying cultural evolution for policy, multi-agent reinforcement learning.
