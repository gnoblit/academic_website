  I am a Senior AI Data Scientist for Lifestyle AI at Electronic Arts where I apply artificial intelligence and machine learning towards game development. 
  
  Previously, I worked closely with clinicians and clinical researchers as the Senior Data Scientist for Children's Hospital Los Angeles to modernize healthcare delivery and clinical research through the strategic application of contemporary statistical methods and natural language processing. Before that, I was a Post-Doctoral Scientist at the [Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society at the University of Toronto](https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca/) and [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), where I used game theory to understand how norms, culture, and political institutions evolve and how such insights can be applied in artificial intelligence. 
  
  I received my Ph.D. from the [Culture, Cognition, and Coevolution Lab](https://coevolution.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University, where I developed econometric and game-theoretic approaches to analyze the interplay between political institutions and cultural evolutionary processes.
