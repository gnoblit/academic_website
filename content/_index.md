description: "I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the [Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society at the University of Toronto](https://srinstitute.utoronto.ca/) and at the [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). My work uses game-theoretic analytical and computational methods to understand the evolution of norms, culture, and political institutions in human societies with a focus on applications in multi-agent reinforcement learning.

I recently graduated with a Ph.D. from the [Culture, Cognition, and Coevolution Lab](https://coevolution.fas.harvard.edu/) and [Department of Human Evolutionary Biology](https://heb.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. Though my interests are broad, they center on the evolution of institutions, human social-learning, and the fascinating relationship between culture and minds and applying cultural evolution towards questions in policy and multi-agent reinforcement learning."
